We have presented a translation of the non-temporal part of TLA + to Cubicle, which makes it possible to feed TLA + specifications into an input language
of existing Cubicle model checker. Source code can be found in below directory:

 1) /src/tla2sany/cubicle/CubicleExporter.java : Transforms TLA+ abstract syntax tree into Cubicle abstract syntax tree.


 2) /src/tla2sany/cubicle/WriteCubicleFile.java : Writes Cubicle abstract syntax tree into a Cubicle input file.
